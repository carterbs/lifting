# Calendar & History Feature

## Description

The Calendar & History feature provides users with a visual timeline of their completed activities across workouts, stretch sessions, and meditation practices. The feature consists of two main views: a basic Calendar view (`/calendar`) and an enhanced History view (`/history`) with activity filtering capabilities.

The calendar displays a monthly grid where each day shows colored activity indicators (dots) representing different activity types: blue for workouts, teal for stretches, and purple for meditations. When users click on any day, a detail dialog opens showing all activities completed on that date, with formatted summaries specific to each activity type.

The History view extends the Calendar view by adding activity type filters at the top, allowing users to focus on specific activity types. Filtering updates both the visible activity dots on the calendar and the activities shown in day detail dialogs. From the day detail dialog, users can click on workout activities to navigate to the detailed workout view page.
